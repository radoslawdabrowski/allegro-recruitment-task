1. My ExceptionHandler can be more sophisticated by using actual Exceptions.
2. DtoConverter should have 1 layer of implementation more, should it be generic -> interface -> implementation instead of generic -> implementation.
3. DtoConverter would be needed much more if response from Github api and response of this service would be different.
4. Static final properties from constraints classes could be Enums with getValue() overridden method but I prefer simpler solution.
5. githubRepositoryNotFound function - switch would be not necessary if I would use custom exceptions instead of that shortcut.
